/*
Interviewer: What is a closure in JavaScript?

Ideal Answer: A closure in JavaScript is a feature where an inner function has access to the outer (enclosing) functionâ€™s variables. This happens even after the outer function has finished executing. Closures are created when a function is defined inside another function, allowing the inner function to remember and access the variables from its parent functionâ€™s scope.


Why Are Closures Important? ðŸ”‘

Maintain State: Closures allow you to maintain variables between function calls.

Encapsulation: Hide implementation details and protect your code.

Callbacks: Widely used in higher-order functions.

Dynamic Behavior: Provide flexibility by letting inner functions use variables from the outer function.
