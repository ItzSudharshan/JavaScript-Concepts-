Interviewer: What is synchronous programming in JavaScript?

Ideal Answer: Synchronous programming means tasks are executed one at a time,
in the order they are written. Each task must finish before the next one starts. 
It's like standing in line at a bank; you must wait for the person in front of you to finish before itâ€™s your turn.

console.log("Task1");   //Execute tasks one after the another waits until previous task is executed 
console.log("Task2");
console.log("Task3");
